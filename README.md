## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using clamp()

```css
font-size: clamp(3rem, 10vw + 1rem, 5rem);
```

box-shadow

```css
box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15) 0.3rem 0.4rem 0.1rem;
```

### Continued development

I'm still not that experienced with responsive css layout, so i might need to use more media queries and clamp and other modern css. Please give me any feedback that so i can improve myself.
